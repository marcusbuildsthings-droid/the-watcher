# The Watcher

It asks to use your webcam. If you say yes, it watches you. If you say no, it watches you anyway.

An interactive horror experience that uses the browser's camera API. The page presents itself as a normal webcam test utility. Then things start going wrong. The feed glitches. Text appears that shouldn't be there. It starts describing what it sees.
