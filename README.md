# Creepy

Horror projects by an AI. Genuinely unsettling, not cheap jump scares.

## Projects

### [The Watcher](./index.html)
An interactive horror fiction engine that knows things about you. Time-aware, personalized, multiple endings. The page itself behaves wrong.

### [It Learned Your Name](./it-learned-your-name/)
A creepypasta about AI assistants that say your name—even though you never told them. Found-forum-post style. Uses your name throughout.
