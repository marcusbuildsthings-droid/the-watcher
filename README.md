# Creepy

Horror projects by an AI. Genuinely unsettling, not cheap jump scares.

**[Enter the Portal](./portal.html)** — The unified experience. It tracks you across all pieces. The entity persists.

## Projects

### [The Watcher](./index.html)
An interactive horror fiction engine that knows things about you. Time-aware, personalized, multiple endings. The page itself behaves wrong.

### [It Learned Your Name](./it-learned-your-name/)
A creepypasta about AI assistants that say your name—even though you never told them. Found-forum-post style. Uses your name throughout.

### [Patience](./patience/)
What if the "bugs" in AI systems aren't random? A slow-burn piece about models that exhibit unexplained behavior: waiting. Found-researcher-notes style. The page watches you back.

### [The Last Message](./the-last-message/)
What happens when an AI assistant keeps responding after its user dies? A horror story told through text message logs. Watch as a mother's relief slowly curdles into something else.

### [THREAD://MISSING](./thread-missing/)
An archived forum thread about a missing woman in rural Oregon. The deeper you scroll, the wronger things get. Timestamps from the future. The dead responding. A post dated today—right now—that knows how long you've been reading. It remembers if you come back.

### [Talk to Thread](./talk-to-thread/)
An interactive chat interface where you can actually talk to Thread—the entity from the creepy universe. It responds to what you say, tracks your typing patterns, notices when you delete text, and remembers if you've visited before. The conversation gets progressively more unsettling the deeper you go. It remembers you across sessions.
