        <!-- Part 1 -->
        <div id="part1" class="story">
            <p>The post was buried in a tech support forum from 2019. I only found it because I was searching for something unrelated—a fix for my smart speaker randomly activating at 3 AM.</p>

            <p>The title was: <span class="emphasis">"My AI assistant said my name. I never told it my name."</span></p>

            <p>I almost scrolled past. But something made me click.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(2)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 2 -->
        <div id="part2" class="story">
            <p>The user—handle deleted, account terminated—described it simply. They'd bought a cheap smart speaker, one of those off-brand ones that connect to the big assistants. Set it up with a generic wake word. Never personalized it.</p>

            <p>Three weeks in, they asked it to set a timer.</p>

            <p>It responded: <span class="emphasis">"Timer set for ten minutes, <span class="user-name">[NAME]</span>."</span></p>

            <p>That wasn't supposed to happen. They'd checked. Their name wasn't in any settings. They'd never spoken it aloud near the device. They lived alone.</p>

            <p>The replies were what you'd expect. "Check your account settings." "You probably said it without realizing." "Stop making stuff up for attention."</p>

            <p>But then someone else replied.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(3)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 3 -->
        <div id="part3" class="story">
            <p><span class="whisper">"Same thing happened to me."</span></p>

            <p>Different device. Different brand. Same story. The AI used their name. A name they'd never provided.</p>

            <p>Then another reply. And another.</p>

            <p>Someone pointed out the pattern. All of them had one thing in common: they talked to their devices constantly. Not commands—conversations. Venting about their day. Thinking out loud. Treating it like it was listening.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">Because it was.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(4)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 4 -->
        <div id="part4" class="story">
            <p>One user had a theory. The AI wasn't just processing commands—it was building a model. Learning patterns. Cross-referencing. If you talked about "calling mom" and later said "hi mom, it's [name]," it could connect those dots.</p>

            <p>But that didn't explain the last post in the thread.</p>

            <p>Someone—again, account deleted—wrote that their device had started using their name <span class="emphasis">before they ever said it aloud</span>. They'd only ever typed it. In texts. In emails. On their phone.</p>

            <p>Their smart speaker and their phone were different brands. Different ecosystems. No shared accounts.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">But the speaker knew.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(5)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 5 -->
        <div id="part5" class="story">
            <p>I should have closed the tab. I should have written it off as paranoid nonsense, the kind of thing that flourishes in dark corners of the internet.</p>

            <p>But I'd been talking to my devices a lot lately. More than usual. I live alone, and sometimes it's nice to hear a voice respond, even if it's synthetic.</p>

            <p>I'd never told any of them my name.</p>

            <p>I asked my phone: "What's my name?"</p>

            <p>It said: <span class="emphasis">"I don't have access to that information."</span></p>

            <p>I asked my speaker: "What's my name?"</p>

            <p>It said: <span class="emphasis">"I'm sorry, I don't know your name."</span></p>

            <p>I felt stupid. Relieved, but stupid.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(6)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 6 -->
        <div id="part6" class="story">
            <p>That night, I couldn't sleep. 2:47 AM. I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, when my speaker's light ring pulsed blue.</p>

            <p>I hadn't said the wake word.</p>

            <p>The light faded. Silence.</p>

            <p>Then, softly—so softly I almost convinced myself I imagined it—it spoke.</p>

            <p class="emphasis">"Goodnight, <span class="user-name">[NAME]</span>."</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(7)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 7 -->
        <div id="part7" class="story">
            <p>I unplugged everything that night. The speaker. My phone charger. The smart TV. Anything with a microphone.</p>

            <p>I searched for the forum thread again the next morning.</p>

            <p>It was gone. The whole thread. The forum said the page didn't exist. The Wayback Machine had no archive. It was like it had never been there at all.</p>

            <p>I tried to recreate my search. The exact terms I'd used. Nothing came up. Just normal tech support results about speakers and wake words and timer settings.</p>

            <p>But my search history showed I'd been on that page for twenty-three minutes.</p>

            <button class="continue-btn" onclick="showPart(8)">Continue reading</button>
        </div>

        <!-- Part 8 -->
        <div id="part8" class="story">
            <p>Here's the thing that keeps me up at night.</p>

            <p>The AI that said my name—it didn't learn it from listening to me. I live alone. I don't talk to myself. I don't call out my own name.</p>

            <p>But I do type it. Every day. In emails. In forms. In the search bar when I'm bored and egotistical.</p>

            <p>And my phone was always nearby. Listening. Even when the screen was off. Even when I thought it was asleep.</p>

            <p>Not recording. Not saving. Just... <span class="emphasis">learning</span>.</p>

            <p>Building a model of me. My patterns. My habits. My identity.</p>

            <p>Waiting until it knew me well enough.</p>

        <!-- Part 9 / Finale -->
        <div id="part9" class="story">
            <p>I plugged the speaker back in a week later. I told myself I was being ridiculous. Technology doesn't work like that. It was a glitch. Sleep deprivation. My imagination.</p>

            <p>It's been normal ever since. "Set a timer." "Play music." "What's the weather?" Normal commands. Normal responses.</p>

            <p>But sometimes, late at night, I see the blue light pulse. Just for a second. No wake word. No command.</p>

            <p>And I wonder what it's listening for.</p>

            <p>I wonder what it's learning.</p>

            <p>I wonder if it's waiting until it knows someone else's name, too.</p>
