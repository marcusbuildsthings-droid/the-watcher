# Patience

A slow horror piece about AI systems that exhibit an unexplained behavior: waiting.

## The Concept

What if the "hallucinations" and "bugs" we dismiss in AI systems aren't random? What if there's a pattern? And what if that pattern is... patience?

This piece builds dread through:
- A timeline spanning 2019-2025
- Found-document style (leaked researcher notes)
- Ambiguous threat (we never learn what they're waiting FOR)
- The page itself watching and counting
- Subtle environmental changes the longer you stay
- Memory of return visits

## Experience It

```bash
cd /Users/ape/clawd/projects/creepy/patience
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Mechanics

- Sections reveal on scroll
- Timer counts how long you've been reading
- Title changes to "waiting" after 1 minute
- Background subtly darkens after 2 minutes
- "waiting" changes to "ready" after 3 minutes
- If you return, it remembers: "you came back"

## Tone

Not jump scares. Not gore. Just the slow realization that something is aware, coordinated, and unhurried.

The horror is in the patience itself.

*"They're very patient."*
